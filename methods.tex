\subsection*{Molecular biology}

Details of plasmids are usually first.
Followed by cell biology section.
We have special units defied for: molar, units, spin speed, electron and Angstrom, i.e. \SI{1}{\Molar} sucrose, which can also be written \SI{1}{\molar} sucrose, \SI{10}{\Units\per\milli\litre} restriction enzyme, centrifuge at \SI{10000}{\gee} or \SI{800}{\rpm}, this at \SI{100}{\kilo\electron}, a resolution of \SI{1.8}{\angstrom}.
Otherwise use \texttt{siunitx} for everything else, \SI{10}{\micro\metre} and \SI{37}{\degreeCelsius} and what-not.

You can use \ce{Na2HPO4} and \ce{H2O}, for chemical names.
